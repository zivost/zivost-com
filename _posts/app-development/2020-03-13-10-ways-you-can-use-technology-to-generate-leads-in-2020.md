##### No leads. No business.

Although this goes without saying and is simple to understand, what's not simple to understand is to how to generate quality leads constantly while being cost-effective at the same time.

In this new digital era, technology has revolutionised the ease of doing business while technology being the biggest business in itself. Interesting?

The good news is that technology has not just helped in easing the businesses but also helped the business generation process itself.

Here's a rundown on how you can leverage modern technology to give your business the boost you deserve in 2020.

Let's get started\!

## 1\. Messaging Automation (Chatbots)

Our clients observed an increase of about 33% by adding a chatbot to their websites as compared to traditional contact forms.

Prospects can come from around the world, might have different understandings, languages and timezones. Missing out on leads can turn out be a massive blow to your ROI.

Chatbots can help you in the following ways:

* ##### Educate leads

  Chatbots can answer common questions automatically so you can educate your prospects without investing in human resources and updating your website. This can also auto-qualify your leads based on the type of questions the prospects are asking.

* ##### Segmentation

  Websites usually display static content which is supposed to serve the mass audience. Your chatbot can segment your audience based on the data they provided like demographics, interests, age, gender, etc.

  For example, suggesting Indian residents a tour package valid for US residents will spoil the customer's experience. A chatbot is smart enough to handle segmentation beautifully.

* ##### Chatbots are there when you can't beâ€¦

  Serve your prospects in every timezone by using chatbots or whenever you are not available to talk.

* ##### Replace forms

  Filling our forms can be tedious task to do. However, chatbots offer an engaging and exiting conversational experience while collecting the same information from your prospects. This will boost your conversion rates up from using the traditional forms.

## 2\. AR/VR

Some organisations like IKEA are using AR (Augmented Reality) technology in their Digital Marketing campaigns to help prospects visualise IKEA's products in their homes. This engages user better and helps in qualification and conversions.

For instance, one can use AR to visualise how an Audi will look in his/her garage or the same person can use VR (Virtual Reality) to visualise how the cabin of his Audi will look like without ever visiting the store physically.

AR/VR can also prove effective in engaging audiences on mobile at trade shows and events to generate more leads and better experiences.

## 3\. QR Codes

Placement of printed QR codes (stickers/standees) at hot spots and places with high & relevant foot-falls can generate leads in an effective way.

##### Example 1:

Your delivery executives can wear T-shirts bearing QR codes at the back. You can scan the code for a hot offer coupon that you will get nowhere else.

##### Example 2:

QR codes containing links to a loan calculators of certain banks can be placed at exhibitions and actual sites can get you leads that are already qualified.

## 4\. Proximity Marketing

In the recent years, proximity marketing has been an effective for retargeting your audience.

Your prospect who did her last purchase 10 months ago is walking past your shoes store, it's about time she wants a new shoe. Why not present her with an attractive offer for your new range of sneakers while she's nearby? Sounds interesting?

This can be made possible using two technologies, Bluetooth Beacons and Geofencing. Both will need your apps installed on your users phone, one is dependant on bluetooth and the other on GPS.

## 5\. Predictive Analysis

The biggest mistake new business make while generating business is viewing every lead as equal. Some leads are easier to convert than other for certain factors. Leads can be scored based on these factors.

Predictive analytics can be incredibly valuable for lead scoring. Changing variables in your lead targeting funnel based on predictive analysis reports can lead to incredible spikes in your conversion rates.

## 6\. Live videos

2020 is going to be the year of Video. Roughly 80% of the audiences will prefer video content over text this year.

Live video can be used to attract customers by giving them an intimate insight into the company's inner working.

## 7\. Social Media

Most of you must be aware of this strategy, read on if you don't.

Your social media platforms can be a gold mine for leads. If you get it right, social media is one of the most valuable and viable strategy. Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat & Twitter are just to name a few but cover most of the social media.

With almost 55% of internet users on social media, it can be used to generate business in massive amounts while keeping the costs incredibly low. If you are not using social media to generate business in 2020, you are missing out on a great opportunity and it's still not too late to start.

## 8\. Automated website personalisation

Even if you are going B2B or B2C, there's always a human behind the company you are targeting.

If you anticipate their needs and offer them a personalised experience, make relevant suggestions before even establishing contact you will be able to increase your conversion rates by multiple folds.

For example, https://gusto.com have tailored homepage for new and returning visitors.

You can use use demographic & behavioural data to serve personalised experience to your visitors, if done properly you might be able to get extraordinary conversion rates.

## 9\. Small but useful Tools

A smart idea to provide your visitors with value would be integrating small but useful tools right into your website/app.

##### Example 1:

Loan providers can place EMI calculators in their websites. If the EMI turns out to be within budget, the customer will be tempted to place an enquiry. Simple.

##### Example 2:

IT companies can put up a form based wizard on their websites that lets them put in their requirements and the wizard will suggest you the perfect tech stack for their product.

Providing value will always add to growth of your business whatever the stage may be, pre-sales or post-sales.

## 10\. Automation

The customer in 2020 tends to but experiences rather than products.

Automation is one such way to provide such experiences by incorporating modern tech and innovations. As the technology develops, it is becoming cheaper and more accessible.

Methods like chatbots, automated cold-email campaigns and personalised website/app experiences are some examples of automation.

Keeping up with what data you should be measuring, storing, or targeting can be cumbersome, difficult and time-consuming. If you're looking to simplify things, automation is your answer\!
